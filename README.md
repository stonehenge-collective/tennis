# Tennis Match Tracker

This repository contains an automated system for tracking tennis matches and calculating player rankings using the Elo rating system. The entire process is managed through GitHub Issues and Actions, making it easy to use, especially on mobile devices.

## Initial Setup (For New Tennis Leagues)

If you're setting up this system for your own tennis league, follow these one-time configuration steps:

### 1. Fork This Repository

- Click the **"Fork"** button at the top of this repository
- Choose your GitHub account or organization as the destination
- Keep the repository name as "tennis" or rename it for your league

### 2. Configure Repository Settings

After forking, you'll need to configure several settings in your new repository:

#### Enable Issues

1. Go to your repository **Settings** â†’ **General**
2. Under "Features", check **"Issues"** to enable them
3. Issues are disabled by default in forks but required for match recording

#### Enable GitHub Actions to Create Pull Requests

1. Go to your repository **Settings** â†’ **Actions** â†’ **General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select **"Read and write permissions"**
3. Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**

Note: If you forked this under an organization, you need to enable the "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" option for the organization or else the organization's setting will override the repository setting.

#### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. This allows the automated workflows to deploy your leaderboard

### 3. Create Required Labels

Create these labels in your repository (**Issues** â†’ **Labels** â†’ **New label**):

- **`new-match`** (color: #0E8A16) - Used by the issue template to trigger match processing
- **`ranking-update`** (color: #0052CC) - Applied to automated ranking update pull requests

### 4. Enable Branch Protection (Required for Match Approvals)

To ensure all players must approve matches before they're recorded, set up branch protection:

1. Go to your repository **Settings** â†’ **Branches**
2. Click **"Add branch protection rule"**
3. Set the branch name pattern to `main` (or your default branch)
4. Enable these settings:
   - âœ… **"Require a pull request before merging"**
   - âœ… **"Require approvals"** (set to **2** - one for each player)
   - âœ… **"Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed"**
   - âœ… **"Require status checks to pass before merging"**
   - âœ… **"Require branches to be up to date before merging"**

This ensures that both players involved in any match must approve the pull request before the match can be officially recorded.

### 5. Add Your Players

Edit the `players.yml` file to include the GitHub usernames of all players in your league (you can delete the example players):

```yaml
- github-username-of-player-1
- github-username-of-player-2
- ...
```

### 6. Update the README Links

Update the live leaderboard link in this README to point to your deployment:

```

For personal accounts:

## How to Record a Match

Follow these simple steps to record a match and have the rankings updated automatically.

1. **Open the Issue Form**: Go to the "Issues" tab of this repository and click on the **"ðŸŽ¾ Record a match"** button.
2. **Fill in the Details**:
    - **Match date**: The date the match was played (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
    - **Players**: The GitHub handles of the two players, separated by a comma. **The winner must be listed first.** (e.g., `@winner, @loser`)
    - **Sets**: The score of each set, one per line. The winner's score must be listed first. (e.g., `6-3`)
3. **Submit the Issue**: Click "Submit new issue".
4. **Review and Approve the PR**: A bot will create a pull request (PR) with the match data. **Both players involved must approve the PR before it can be merged.**
5. **Merge the PR**: Once both players have approved the PR, it can be merged. The rankings will be automatically updated within a minute or two.

That's it! No command line, no code, just a simple form.

## Ranking System

Player rankings are calculated using the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). After each match is merged, an automated workflow recalculates the ratings and creates a pull request with the updated `ranking.csv` file. Once that PR is merged, the [live leaderboard](https://stonehenge-collective.github.io/sc-tenis-league) is updated automatically.
